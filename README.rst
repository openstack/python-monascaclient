Python bindings to the Monasca API
==================================

This is a client library for Monasca built to interface with the Monasca API.
It provides a Python API (the ``monascaclient`` module) and a command-line tool
(``monasca``).

The Monasca Client was written using the OpenStack Heat Python client as a
framework.

Ubuntu Install
--------------
Requires::

  pip - version >= 1.4.  python get-pip.py

See versions on PYPI:
  https://pypi.org/project/python-monascaclient/

Install It::

  sudo pip install python-monascaclient

Alternative Manual Install Steps::

  cd <path to your python-monascaclient repo>

  sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

  python setup.py install

Building and Packaging
----------------------
Install the tool dependencies::

  sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv

In the python-monascaclient source directory::

  virtualenv --no-site-packages .venv

  source ./.venv/bin/activate

  pip install wheel

  python setup.py bdist_wheel

  pip install $(ls -1rt dist/*.whl | tail -1) --upgrade

Command-line API
----------------
Installing this distribution gets you a shell command, ``monasca``, that you
can use to interact with the Monitoring API server.

Usage:

.. code-block:: console

  monasca

  monasca help

  monasca help <command>

    This outputs the results in json format.  Normally output is in table format.


The monascaclient CLI needs the Monasca API endpoint url and the OS_AUTH_TOKEN
to pass to the Monasca API RESTful interface. This is provided through
environment or CLI parameters.

Environmental Variables
=======================

Environmental variables can be sourced, or optionally passed in as CLI
arguments. It is easiest to source them first and then use the CLI.

When token and endpoint are known::

  export OS_AUTH_TOKEN=XXX
  export MONASCA_API_URL=http://192.168.10.4:8070/v2.0/

When using Keystone to obtain the token and endpoint::

  export OS_USERNAME=
  export OS_PASSWORD=
  export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=
  export OS_PROJECT_NAME=
  export OS_AUTH_URL=
  export OS_REGION_NAME=
  # Optional(specific version added to OS_AUTH_URL if (v2.0 or v3) not present already)
  export OS_AUTH_VERSION=

When OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME is not set, then 'Default' is assumed. Alternatively
IDs can be used instead of names.
Although *deprecated*, but OS_TENANT_NAME and OS_TENANT_ID can be used for
OS_PROEJCT_NAME and OS_PROJECT_ID respectively.

When using Vagrant Environment with middleware disabled::

  export OS_AUTH_TOKEN=82510970543135
  export OS_NO_CLIENT_AUTH=1
  export MONASCA_API_URL=http://192.168.10.4:8070/v2.0/

The Monasca API will treat the auth token as the tenant ID when Keystone is not
enabled.
